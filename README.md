Fine-Tune Llama 2
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Llama 2 model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The script fine_tune_llama_2.py includes steps for preparing data, fine-tuning the model, and saving the fine-tuned model.

Features
Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tunes the Llama 2 model on a custom dataset.
Model Merging: Merges LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) weights with the base model.
Model Saving: Saves the fine-tuned model and tokenizer to the Hugging Face Hub.
Text Generation: Utilizes the fine-tuned model for text generation tasks.
